# Competitive Programming

This repository contains my solutions to competitive programming problems from various platforms and contests.  
I use this space to practice algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills in preparation for contests and long-term mastery.

## Structure
- Each folder corresponds to a platform, contest, or topic.
- Solutions are written primarily in C++.
- File names usually match the problem name or contest code.

## Goals
- Improve consistency and accuracy in solving problems.
- Build a personal archive of solved problems for revision.
- Track progress toward higher competitive programming ratings.

## Topics Covered
- Data Structures (arrays, trees, graphs, heaps, etc.) soon
- Algorithms (greedy, DP, binary search, graph algorithms, etc.)
- Math and number theory
- String algorithms
- Miscellaneous CP techniques

## How to Navigate
Browse the directories to find solutions grouped by platform or topic.  
Each solution includes the source code and, when helpful, short notes or explanations.
